## Screenshot Guidelines

When taking screenshots:

- Use a clean Moodle installation with default theme
- Ensure text is readable (high resolution)
- Capture relevant UI elements without excessive whitespace
- Use consistent browser and window size
- Include relevant navigation breadcrumbs
- Blur any sensitive information (usernames, IDs if not example data)

## Image Format

- **Format**: PNG (preferred) or JPG
- **Resolution**: Minimum 1200px width
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB per image (optimize if needed)
- **Naming**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `package-list.png`)

## Adding Images

1. Place image files in this directory
2. Reference in documentation using relative path:
   ```markdown
   ![Description](images/filename.png)
   ```
3. Add alt text for accessibility
4. Optionally add caption below image

## Current Status

⚠️ **Screenshots pending**: All screenshot placeholders are currently in the documentation but actual images need to be captured and added.
